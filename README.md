Developed an APEX simulator using Java for out-of-order instructions with different Functional Units and Cycle latencies.
It manipulates the code from the file written in Assembly language and outputs cycle-by-cycle processes after using forwarding and pipelining concepts. 

Tools used: Eclipse IDE
